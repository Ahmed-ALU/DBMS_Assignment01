# DBMS_Assignment01
This repository contains the codes and the designs for the second assignment for the course "Database Systems" in my year two at The African Leadership University n Rwanda. The assignment was individual work.


### Assignment Prompt:

Context

A pharmacy like other businesses has a way in which its operations are performed. Every detail from medicine, shelves, customers, customer feedback, and sales are captured and stored for the sake of easy information processing, retrieval, sharing and sound decision making.

In this context either file systems or DBMSs can be used to achieve the goal irrespective of the implementation cost.

Tasks to be performed:

To what extent do users prefer to use file systems and  how do DBMSs outweigh file systems in the context given? Use the context given to clarify what RDBMS is and how it will be implemented using given details. (5pts)
Identify all the entities in the context (as less as the obvious entities, and many as you can derive). Associate every entity with its respective attributes. (5pts)
Write complete data dictionaries for the context (entities, attributes, constraints, data type and the respective length)(5Pts)
Give a complete E-R diagram (ensure all relationships and cardinalities are demonstrated). (5Pts)
